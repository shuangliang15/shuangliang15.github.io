Consider a discrete dynamical system $F \colon \mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}^d$ with a smooth map $F$. Let $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ be a fixed point and $J$ be the Jacobian of $F$ at $x$. 

* If the norm of all eigenvalues of $J$ is less than one, then $x$ is attracting (there exists a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that all orbits in $U$ converges to $x$)![^1]. 

* If at least one eigenvalue
