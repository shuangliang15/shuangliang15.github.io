The [Cantor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_function) $f$, defined on $[0,1]$, satisfies:
* $f$ is continuous everywhere
* $f'=0$ a.e. 
* $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$, and $f$ is non-decreasing. 

The main issue is: it is not absolutely continuous and thus the fundamental theorem of calculus fails.
