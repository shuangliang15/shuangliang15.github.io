Let $R$ be the loss functional defined on the space probability measures $P(\mathbb{R}^n)$: 

$$
R(\rho) = \Big( \int \sigma(x_0, \theta) d \rho(\theta) - y_0 \Big)^2
$$

where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the layer-wise parameter and $\sigma$ is the activation function. $\rho$ describes a partical system. 
(Nothing changes with multiple data points, except for the exact form of the derivative below.)

With direct computation, we have that

$$
\frac{\partial R}{\partial \rho}(\eta) = \int \Big(\int \sigma\left(x_0, \theta^{\prime}\right) d \rho\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)-y_0\Big) \cdot \sigma\left(x_0, \theta\right) d \eta(\theta)
\triangleq \int \Psi(\rho, \theta) d \eta(\theta). 
$$

**Interpreting $\Psi_\rho = \Psi(\rho, \cdot) $.**

Fix a system $\rho$. Consider moving a partical from $\theta$ to $\theta+\Delta \theta$ (without changing the mass). Loosely, the first-order change on the loss $R$ is:

$$
\Delta R \approx \frac{\partial R}{\partial \rho}(\rho)(-\delta_\theta + \delta_{\theta+\Delta \theta}) = \Psi_\rho(\theta+\Delta \theta) - \Psi_\rho(\theta) \approx \nabla_\theta \Psi_\rho(\theta) \cdot \Delta \theta. 
$$

Therefore, at a given position $\theta$, the fastest way to decrease $R$ is to move the partical along the direction $-\nabla_\theta \Psi_\rho(\theta)$.

Recall that the continuity equation is 

$$
\partial_t \rho_t = - \nabla \cdot (\rho_t \cdot v)
$$

where $\rho_t \cdot v$ is called the flux and $v$ is the velocity field that describes the flux.


Putting everything together, we have the meanfield PDE:

$$
\partial_t \rho_t = \nabla_\theta \cdot (\rho_t \cdot \nabla_\theta \Psi(\rho_t, \theta)). 
$$
