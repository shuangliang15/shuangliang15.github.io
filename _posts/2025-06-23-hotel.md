### Hilbert's grand hotel
Consider a hotel with inifinitely many rooms, all of which are occupied. Now if we move the guest in room k to room k+m (for k=1,2,...), then we will get m new empty rooms. 
If we move the guest in room k to room 2k, we will get infinitely many new empty rooms. It seems empty rooms can be created from nowhere. 

The original status of the hotel can be modeld by the series: 
$$
(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots=0. 
$$ 
And the status after m-step move is 
$$
1+1 \cdots +1 + (1-1) + (1-1) +\cdots = m. 
$$
Although the latter can be obtained from reordering the former, these two series are completely different.

The main issue is: if a series is not absolute convergent, one can not ``manipulate'' the terms and expect the sum to remain unchanged.

### Thomson's Lamp 
Consider this one-hour-long task: flick the switcth of the lamp after 30 minutes pass, then flick after another 15 minutes pass, then 7.5 minutes, etc. 
These time intervals form a geometric series and thus after one hour, one would flick the switch infintiely many times. 
Then the question is: what is the status of the lamp at the end? 

The procedure can be described by the series $+1-1+1-1\cdots$, which diverges. Hence, the answer is: the status, as a limit, is not well-define. 

<br>
The main issue is: the question uses the "geometric time interval" trick to rescale the inifnity to a finite value. 
Then our intuition (about past finite-time tasks) tends to tell us the lamp should be in a determined, well-defined status.

### Ross-Littlewood Vase
Consider infinitely many balls, numbered by 1,2, and so on. Consider this one-hour-long task: after 30 minutes passes put balls 1-10 into the vase and draw ball 1 out from the vase; after 15 minutes, put 11-20 in and draw 2 out, etc. 
The question is: how many balls are there in the vase at the end?

One obvious answer is ininfity, as at each step the total number increases by 9. But another answer is zero, as for any ball, it will be drawn after finite steps. 

This problem can be modeld as the following table:

$$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\\hline
  & 1 & 2 & 3 & \cdots \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots \\ \hline
2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\ \hline
3 & 0 & -1 & 0 & \cdots \\ \hline
\\end{array}
$$

where the columns correspond to ball indices, the rows correspond to steps, and the entry is one if the ball is added, zero if nothing happens, minus one if the ball is taken out. 

Hence, the previous first answer corresponds to first summing up the rows and then summing up the columns; while the second correspond to the reverse order. 

The main issue is: the infinite sum of the table is ill-defined in the first place, hence different order of sum give different answers. In the meantime, the "geometric time interval" compress infinity to finite value and our intuition become irreliable.
