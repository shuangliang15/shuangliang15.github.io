Openness and closedness depend on the subspace, but compactness does not.

$[0,1)$ is an open set in $[0,+\infty)$; and $(0,1]$ is a closed set in $(0,+\infty)$. 

This often gives me an **incorrect** impression that compactness also depends on the subspace. 

In fact, for $K \subset A \subset B$, $K$ is compact in $A$ iff $K$ is compact in $B$ (assuming subspace topology). 


Intuition: 
$K$ is compact in any ambient space iff if $K$, itself, is a compact topological space when endowed with the subspace topology. 
Clearly, whether viewed as a subset of $A$ or $B$, $K$ remains the same topological space. 
In this sense, compactness is somehow intrinsic.
