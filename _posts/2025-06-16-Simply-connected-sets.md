On $\mathbb{S}^2$, consider two open disks, one covering the north pole and the other covering the south pole. 
Let their sizes grow until they meet at the equator. The intersection of these two simply connected open sets deformation retracts to $\mathbb{S}^1$, and thus is not simply connected. Don't overlook the underlying topology when doing mind experiments.
