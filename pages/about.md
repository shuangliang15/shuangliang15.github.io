_“The best time to learn is when truth conflicts with intuition.”_ — Chen-Ning Yang (paraphrased)

<br>

Hi! I am a phd student at UCLA studying deep learning theory ([my personal website](https://sites.google.com/view/shuang-liang/)). 
Intuition is like the north star of my research journey, and thus I believe that continually fixing intuition is a very important part of learning. 

<br>

Here, I collect ideas and facts that initially conflicted with my intuition. 
I suppose keeping these documented would be helpful to me, and hopefully, to you, the reader. 
I hope you enjoy the content!
