_“When intuition conflicts with truth, that’s the best time to learn.”_
— Chen-Ning Yang (paraphrased)

<br><br>

Hi! I am a phd student at UCLA studying deep learning theory. Here is my [website](https://sites.google.com/view/shuang-liang/). 
Intuition is like the north star of my research journey, and thus I believe that continually fixing intuition is a very important part of _learning_. 

<br><br>

Here, I collect ideas and facts that initially conflicted with my intuition. 
I suppose keeping these documented would be helpful to me, and hopefully, to you, the reader. 
I hope you enjoy the content!
